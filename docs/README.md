# Preface

Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that combines various areas of engineering and computer science to develop intelligent systems. The application of mechatronics in industrial processes, such as manufacturing, automation, robotics, and process control, has led to a significant improvement in productivity, efficiency, and flexibility. The course TPK4128 Industrial Mechatronics at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway, focuses on providing students with the knowledge and skills required to design, program, and implement industrial mechatronics systems.

This compendium aims to support the course by providing an in-depth understanding of the topics covered in the lectures. The course covers a wide range of topics, starting from the basics of Linux, Python, and C/C++ programming to advanced topics such as OPC Unified Architecture, ROS2, and industry 4.0. The course also covers the use of single-board computers, PLC-based systems, embedded- and real-time systems, industrial bus systems, operating systems, and communication protocols.

The book is structured according to the course lectures, which are designed to build on one another. The first chapter introduces the course and provides an overview of mechatronics in industrial applications. The second chapter covers computer architecture and operating systems, specifically Linux. The third chapter focuses on embedded and real-time systems, including PREEMPT_RT Linux and FreeRTOS. The fourth chapter covers networking, including the OSI model, UDP, and TCP/IP socket programming. The fifth chapter delves into network protocols and industrial bus systems, specifically implementing MODBUS TCP. The sixth chapter covers network middleware, serialization, and inter-process communication, including DDS, Protocol Buffers, and MQTT. The seventh chapter focuses on Industry 4.0, instrumentation, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The eighth chapter covers OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), which is used for exchanging data between devices and systems. The ninth chapter introduces ROS2 (Robot Operating System) and its use for real-time robot control. The tenth chapter covers industrial PCs and programmable logic controllers (PLC), which are the backbone of modern industrial systems. The eleventh chapter focuses on PLC programming, specifically IEC 61131-3 and the programming languages used in it. The twelfth chapter covers sensors and actuators, including power supplies, motor drives, pneumatic and hydraulic actuators. The thirteenth chapter focuses on dependability and system development methodologies. Finally, the fourteenth chapter provides a summary of the course.

The book is written in a way that allows students to easily follow the lectures and understand the topics covered. It includes numerous examples, illustrations, and diagrams to aid in learning. Furthermore, the book provides practical exercises that allow students to apply the knowledge they have acquired and develop their skills in industrial mechatronics. We hope that this book will be a useful resource for students, researchers, and professionals interested in mechatronics and its applications in industrial systems.

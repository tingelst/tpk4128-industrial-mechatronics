2.5 Process Management and Scheduling

In industrial mechatronics systems, efficient process management and scheduling are crucial for ensuring that control algorithms, data acquisition, and communication tasks execute in a timely and orderly manner. This section discusses the principles of process management and scheduling in Linux, as well as their relevance to industrial mechatronics applications.
1.	Process Management: Processes are instances of running programs, and the Linux operating system is responsible for their creation, execution, and termination. Linux process management encompasses the following aspects:
    - Process States: Processes in Linux have various states, such as ready, running, blocked, or terminated. The operating system manages transitions between these states in response to events like I/O requests or process completion.
    - Process Hierarchy: Processes in Linux are organized in a hierarchical structure, with a parent-child relationship. When a process creates a new process, the new process becomes a child of the parent process. This hierarchy simplifies resource allocation and termination of related processes.
    - Process Identification (PID): Each process in Linux is assigned a unique process identification number (PID) to distinguish it from other processes. PIDs enable process monitoring and management using commands like ps, top, and kill.
2.	Scheduling: Scheduling is the process by which the operating system allocates CPU time to processes based on their priority and resource requirements. Linux employs several scheduling algorithms, such as the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) and the real-time scheduling policies, SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR.
    - Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS): CFS is the default scheduler in Linux, designed to provide fair allocation of CPU time to processes based on their priority (nice value). CFS uses a virtual runtime and a time-ordered red-black tree data structure to determine which process should run next.
    - Real-Time Scheduling: In many industrial mechatronics applications, real-time performance is required for precise control and synchronization of processes. Real-time scheduling policies like SCHED_FIFO (First In, First Out) and SCHED_RR (Round Robin) prioritize real-time processes over non-real-time processes and ensure that critical tasks are executed within strict time constraints.
3.	Inter-Process Communication (IPC): As mentioned in the previous sections, IPC mechanisms such as pipes, message queues, and shared memory are crucial for coordinating the operation of various components in industrial mechatronics systems, like control algorithms, data acquisition tasks, and communication processes.
4.	Linux Process Management Tools: Linux provides various tools and utilities for process management and monitoring, such as `ps`, `top`, `htop`, and `kill`. Familiarity with these tools is essential for troubleshooting and optimizing industrial mechatronics systems.

In conclusion, efficient process management and scheduling are vital for the reliable operation of industrial mechatronics systems. Understanding the principles of process management, scheduling algorithms, inter-process communication, and Linux process management tools enables engineers and developers to design and implement robust, high-performance mechatronics solutions that meet the stringent requirements of the industry.
